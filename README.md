## Features
- Intuitive and modern user interface
    - Load on demand, infinite scrolling
    - Fast and interactive filtering

#### Load on demand, infinite scrolling
Viewing a table will eagerly load only the first page, scrolling to the bottom of the page
loads the next records, up until the last page

#### Fast and interactive filtering
Filter records as you type in text into their corresponding columns and displays only the matching records.
